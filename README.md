- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylor-atDD0G
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with Datadog customers wherever they live virtually!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything about software and developing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how Datadog can drive faster cloud adoption, break down siloes between teams, and get Engineers back to doing what they were hired to do.
- 📫 How to reach me: taylor.hatchett@datadoghq.com
